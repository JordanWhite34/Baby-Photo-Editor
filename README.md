# Baby-Photo-Editor

This is a Python-based image processing tool created as a final project for EE 440 at the University of Washington. The tool is built using Tkinter for the graphical user interface and OpenCV for image processing tasks.

### Features
The tool allows users to apply various image processing techniques to an input image, including:

Blurring
Saturation adjustment (desaturation)
Contrast adjustment
Temperature adjustment (warm/cool)
Adding noise
Exposure adjustment
Requirements
To use this tool, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:

#### tkinter
#### opencv-python (cv2)
#### Pillow (PIL.Image)


### Usage
To run the tool, simply execute the Python script. The tool will display the original image and the modified image side by side. You can use the sliders provided in the tool to adjust the intensity of the image processing techniques applied to the input image. There already is a sample image but if you want to use your own image, put a .bmp type file in the same directory as the script and name it 'test.bmp'.

The tool will display two images: the original image on the left side and the modified image on the right side. As you adjust the sliders, the modified image will update in real-time to reflect the applied image processing techniques.
